Largest and catalytic component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Forms the polymerase active center together with the second largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB1 is part of the core element with the central large cleft, the clamp element that moves to open and close the cleft and the jaws that are thought to grab the incoming DNA template. At the start of transcription, a single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned within the central active site cleft of Pol II. A bridging helix emanates from RPB1 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol II by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. During transcription elongation, Pol II moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Elongation is influenced by the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II largest subunit (RPB1), which serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation, termination and mRNA processing (By similarity).

Can also prevent aggregation of unfolded proteins also in an ATP-independent manner (PubMed:18782221). Targets polyubiquitinated proteins for proteasomal degradation by binding to 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:19545544).

In particular, protects against chromosome non-disjunction and nuclear fragmentation during meiotic double-strand break repair to ensure sister chromatid recombination and aid chromosome stability (PubMed:14711411, PubMed:18219312, PubMed:24424777).

Within the heterodimeric GABA receptor, only gbb-1 seems to bind agonists, while gbb-2 mediates coupling to G proteins (By similarity). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase (By similarity). Signaling inhibits adenylate cyclase, stimulates phospholipase A2, activates potassium channels, inactivates voltage-dependent calcium-channels and modulates inositol phospholipid hydrolysis (By similarity). Plays a critical role in the fine-tuning of inhibitory synaptic transmission (By similarity). Pre-synaptic GABA receptor inhibits neurotransmitter release by down-regulating high-voltage activated calcium channels, whereas postsynaptic GABA receptor decreases neuronal excitability by activating a prominent inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) conductance that underlies the late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (By similarity). Along with gbb-1, may couple to the G(o) alpha G-protein goa-1 to negatively regulate cholinergic receptor activity in the presence of high levels of acetylcholine in ventral cord motor neurons (PubMed:18614679). As acetylcholine depolarizes body wall muscles, modulation of acetylcholine levels most likely results in the control of locomotory behavior (PubMed:18614679).

When unphosphorylated and in its active form, interacts with E2F transcription factors such as efl-1 to repress their transcriptional activity and negatively regulate the progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle during postembryonic development (PubMed:11684669, PubMed:12062054, PubMed:15238519, PubMed:17466069, PubMed:25562820). May furthermore act with cell cycle regulator cki-1 to negatively regulate cell cycle progression (PubMed:11684669). Acts redundantly with lin-53, fzr-1 and lin-23 to control cell cycle progression by regulating the expression of G1 phase cyclins (PubMed:11850412, PubMed:25562820). In particular, negatively regulates the expression of the cyclin E homolog cye-1, which is essential for the G1/S phase transition (PubMed:16287966, PubMed:17466069). Regulates cell division in the intestinal lineage, repressing the expression of genes such as cdc-25.2, which are required for intestinal cells to transition from the karyokinesis cell cycle (also known as nuclear division) to endoreplication, a specific growth pathway in the intestinal epithelium required for feeding and gut development in growing larvae during the L1 stage molt (PubMed:17466069, PubMed:27104746). Its role as a transcriptional repressor in the regulation of intestinal cell division during postembryonic development is most likely in complex with an E2F cell cycle regulatory transcription factor efl-1 and its binding partner the synthetic multivulva class B protein dpl-1 (PubMed:17466069). Synthetic multivulva (synMuv) class B protein (PubMed:9875852, PubMed:11850412). SynMuv proteins are required to repress the induction of vulval development by Ras signaling and probably act by forming the multiprotein DRM complex that represses transcription (PubMed:9875852, PubMed:17075059). Together with synMuv class B protein lin-53, and redundantly with synMuv class A protein lin-15A, represses transcription to control vulval development, most likely through antagonization of the Ras-signaling pathway in the major hypodermal syncytium hyp7 (PubMed:9875852, PubMed:15621535, PubMed:16624904, PubMed:26100681). Acts redundantly with the transcriptional corepressor spr-1 and the zinc finger protein zfp-2 to play a role in vulval morphogenesis, promote germline proliferation and somatic gonad development (PubMed:17417969, PubMed:17070797). Acts redundantly with ubc-18 in the regulation of pharyngeal morphogenesis during embryonic develpment by negatively regulating the expression of proteins such as sup-35 (PubMed:12783801, PubMed:19521497, PubMed:24214340). Functions with the SWI/SNF complex and proteins such as pha-1 to regulate larval development (PubMed:15196946, PubMed:15280233). Functions redundantly with xnp-1 to regulate somatic gonad development (PubMed:15328017, PubMed:15649460). Acts redundantly with slr-2 to regulate the expression of intestinal genes required for nutrient utilization (PubMed:18437219, PubMed:22542970). Regulates transcription in response to starvation (PubMed:23664972). Furthermore, in response to starvation, promotes germ cell programmed cell death by negatively regulating the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein ced-9 (PubMed:17881492, PubMed:24752899). Conversely, in conjunction with mcd-1, efl-1 and the synthetic multivulva class B proteins dpl-1, lin-37 and lin-52, may also regulate transcription to promote programmed cell death independently of ced-1, ced-8 and ced-9 cell death pathways (PubMed:17237514). Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation (PubMed:23347407). In particular, negatively regulates the expression of mes-4, a histone methyltransferase that controls the expression of germline specific genes (PubMed:23347407). May play a role in double strand break formation during meiosis (PubMed:15315757). May suppress sensitivity to RNAi (PubMed:16507136, PubMed:17417969).

The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inner membrane that drives transmembrane transport and the ATP synthase. Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Electrons originating from reduced cytochrome c in the intermembrane space (IMS) are transferred via the dinuclear copper A center (CU(A)) of subunit 2 and heme A of subunit 1 to the active site in subunit 1, a binuclear center (BNC) formed by heme A3 and copper B (CU(B)). The BNC reduces molecular oxygen to 2 water molecules using 4 electrons from cytochrome c in the IMS and 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P00410}.", Mitochondrion inner membrane {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P00410}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P00410}.,
